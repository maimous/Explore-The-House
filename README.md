* In VS, create a Windows Forms Application project.

&nbsp;
## 01 Add the abstract class Location
* Add the abstract class Location.
* The constructor sets the name field, which is the read-only Name property.
* The public Exits field is an array of Location references that keeps track of all of the other places that this location connects to.
* The base Description property returns a string that describes the room, including the name and a list of all of the locations it connects to (which it finds in the Exits[] field). Its subclasses will need to change the description slightly, so theyâ€™ll override it.
